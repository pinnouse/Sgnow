## Description

Sgnow is really cool. Written in [rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) because it's
fast, whilst being super safe too. Developed using webview - keeps filesizes
small, visuals minimal, and most things native (the best part is that it doesn't
use electron!!).

**But *why* you may ask?** As a~~n epic~~ gamer and music lover, I like to
listen to music while I play games. The problem is that many common apps that do
that either aren't very pretty, or use *electron* which takes up a heck of a lot
of resources. The goal of this project was to build a tiny-footprint application
that's skinnable/hackable, super fast, while still providing a great feast for
the eyes and ears.
