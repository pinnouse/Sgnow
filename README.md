## Description

Sgnow is really cool. Written in [rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) because it's
fast, whilst being super safe too. Using electron because there really aren't
enough native rust options. All the heavylifting will be done in rust, but
interface and frontend will be through electron.

**But *why* you may ask?** As a~~n epic~~ gamer and music lover, I like to
listen to music while I play games. The problem is that many common apps that do
that either aren't very pretty, or use a heck of a lot of resources. The goal
of this project was to build a tiny-footprint application that's super fast and
skinnable/hackable, while still providing a great feast for the eyes and ears.

I've succumbed to using electron.

> It just works.
